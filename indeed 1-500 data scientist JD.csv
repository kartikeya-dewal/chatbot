all Australia, every day.
We are Australia's national weather, climate and water agency, in the Environment and Energy portfolio
of the Australian Government, operating under the authority of the Meteorology Act 1955 and the Water
Act 2007. We have expertise and services to help Australian prepare and respond to the realities of their
natural environment, including droughts, floods, fires, storms, tsunami and tropical cyclones.
Our products and services include observations, forecasts, analysis and advice covering Australia's
atmosphere, water, oceans and space environments. We also undertake scientific research in support
of our operations and services. Through regular forecasts, warnings, monitoring and advice, we provide
one of Australia's most fundamental and widely-used public services.
Our employees and contractors work across Australia and remote islands, providing services from the
Antarctic to beyond the equator, and from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific.

If so, this opportunity may be for you. At Nearmap, we're growing our AI Systems, and we’re after a machine learning engineer who’s got enough experience to just come in and get stuck in.
At Nearmap, we have petabytes of high quality aerial imagery (covering half a million square kilometres a year at 5-7cm resolution, and regularly captured imagery back to 2009). We've also just started producing automated 3D models of entire cities. Couple that with recent progress in deep learning, cloud based GPU compute, and the opportunity to work with a vast network of customers and partners eager to extract commercial value through machine learning for a wide range of industries and applications, and you'll appreciate why data science at Nearmap is an exciting place to be. As a mature publicly listed startup, we have both the resources to allow you to succeed in your role, and the agility (thanks to cloud-based infrastructure) to rapidly take advantage of the latest developments in the field.
You will work within a team of data scientists, statisticians and engineers. Your particular expertise and passion, however, is in modern deep learning methods applied to computer vision. You’re capable of moving well beyond pre-trained keras models, eager and capable of coming up with custom architectures to take advantage of our rich data set of 2D, multi-view and 3D data.
A bit more about the culture…
At Nearmap, every opinion matters, our business model partnered with our open-door management style gives you the opportunity to make an impact. Our Nearmappers see the world differently and are intently focused on delivering the best location content in the world. Having a shared goal and a lot of fun reaching it is how our Nearmappers truly flourish at their home away from home. We're all super down-to-earth - except when we're in the sky capturing fresh imagery!
More about what you need to bring…
The main attributes we're after are:
Pragmatism: While extensive knowledge of deep learning and computer is highly valued, pragmatism wins over elaborate theory when it comes to shipping products that work.
Collaboration: We believe data science is a team sport, and are after candidates who can communicate well, share knowledge, and be open to taking on ideas from anyone in the team. Having worked on shared code-bases in a commercial environment is a big plus, but it's the attitude that matters most.
Technical Skills: A base of python, linux, and modern machine learning are key to any role in the team. The focus of this particular role is not just the ability to apply machine learning, but some solid experience doing it within the realm of imagery and conv nets. Experience with Keras, Tensorflow, 2D, multi-view and 3D data are highly valued.
Education and Experience: At minimum, a technical bachelors level degree (engineering, sciences, etc.), with a few years of experience beyond that (commercial or research) working with imagery.
Attention to detail: Showing attention to detail when it counts is important... to be considered for this role, click this link and apply some basic data science skills https://www.dropbox.com/s/tw1y3dc32e6la5h/test.tar.gz?dl=0

164,Marketing Analyst,Deliveroo,Melbourne VIC,"Why Deliveroo?
When you first think about Deliveroo, you probably think of getting great food to your house in less than half an hour. Awesome right? But behind the scenes is the real story. This story is one of high growth, huge challenges and an enormous opportunity ahead of us. It began with our founder Will, arriving in London over 5 years ago and finding it almost impossible to order great food, despite the wealth of incredible restaurants in the city. Fast forward 5 years and we operate in 13 countries with over 50,000 riders who deliver orders from 50,000 restaurants in over 200 cities worldwide.
We want to be the definitive food company - the app you go to any time you have a hunger pang. We are transforming the way people think about food. We are providing people with limitless access to different cuisines and restaurants, turning cooking from a chore to a choice, and giving people the freedom to eat what they want, when they want, where they want it.
We work with riders, restaurants and consumers. We operate one of the most complex three sided marketplaces in the world and we do this in real time. Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds. The algorithms behind that marketplace are the secret sauce that allow us to deliver our orders in under 30 minutes.
And we’re just getting started
The scale of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. The global food market is valued at £7.7 trillion but only 1% of it is currently online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of countless other industries - from banking and travel to retail and communications - it’s clear that our journey in the food sector has only just begun.
We are already a multi-billion dollar company that is more than doubling in size every year. Deliveroo came top in the FT’s’ list of Europe’s fastest growing 1000 companies in 2018, and we were the first company ever to win Deloitte’s ‘UK Top 50’ two years in a row. Yet most of the extraordinary value this company will generate lies ahead of us.
The Role
We are looking for a Marketing Analyst to join our team based in our Melbourne Head Office. The primary role of the Marketing Analyst will be to support the marketing team with various data requests. This role is responsible for the creation and design of reports and reporting tools as well as the provision of data analysis to deliver insights to key decision makers to assist in all marketing planning and analysis.
The role will involve:
Providing analytical support across the broader marketing team, by assisting in setting up effective post-analysis and reporting
Analysing the impact of marketing activity on business performance
Support marketing in driving campaign effectiveness through ongoing optimisation of data selection and KPI development
Creating and managing visualisation analysis using Looker, excel and other programs
Collaborating with other data scientists and marketing colleagues to drive and continually improve reporting solutions
Converting gathered data into easily comprehensible information and dispersing insights and recommendations across the team and management
Understanding and optimising return on marketing investment
Continually improving all data processes within the marketing team.
Creation, roll out & ownership of processes, tools and reporting dashboards to improve internal efficiency
Support marketing team with Ad hoc analysis, insights and reporting requests
Requirements:
The ideal candidate is highly analytical with a strong set of organizational and communication skills. You’ll be able to think strategically, validate your assumptions with data, and then execute quickly on your plans.
You should also be:
Driven, hard-working and agile. We move fast at Deliveroo and you’ll be comfortable with the same
Extremely analytical and have a passion for detail, marketing and data crunching
Resourceful, creative, and with a keen eye for leveraging data insights to help our marketing team make more insightful business decisions. You’re detail-oriented and able to maintain a high level of accuracy across all aspects of your work.
Able to create reports and dashboards such as Looker, Power Bi or Tableau to be used by marketing and business stakeholders
Comfortable working with individuals at all levels. You must be a team player and able to galvanise support from colleagues across departments and cities.
An expert in Excel. Experience using SQL, Looker and Google Suite would be beneficial
Life at Deliveroo
We are a growing team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we’re always looking for new ideas and we’re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.
There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven’t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.
Benefits and Diversity
At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.
In 2018 we announced our decision to give every employee equity in the company. We did this because we wanted all of our employees, regardless of location, level or role to be owners and because we believe that this is the right thing to do. We believe this helps build a culture where everyone is committed and able to share in the company’s success.
We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing start-up’s around."

189,Student / Intern: Machine Learning driven software bug detection,Oracle,Brisbane QLD,"Student / Intern: Machine Learning driven software bug detection-190013BD

Preferred Qualifications
A six month, full time research internship, starting January 2020 is available at Oracle Labs

The objective of this internship is to detect program bugs through semantic modelling of source code. As bug detection is usually considered as a classification problem, it is crucial to select suitable features that can distinguish buggy programs from bug-free ones. However, identifying such discriminating features through manual analysis or heuristics still remain challenging.

This internship will explore Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to model source code such that program semantics are precisely captured. Graphs are the basic data-structure for any analysis of programs, hence, graph-based source code representation is ideal for bug detection. Programs are represented as abstract syntax tree, control-flow or data-flow graph and neural graph embedding technique is applied to learn a vector representation of programs. Finally, machine learning classifier (e.g, SVM) is used to detect whether a program is buggy or bug-free. Specifically, we are interested in detection of memory related bugs in C/C++, such as use-after-free, double-free and so on.

Supervisors: Mahin Chandramohan, Cristina Cifuentes

Mahin Chandramohan is a Senior Researcher for Oracle Labs, Australia, leading machine learning efforts in the Program Analysis group.

Cristina Cifuentes is the Senior Director of Oracle Labs Australia. She has incepted and transferred a variety of research and advanced development projects, including Parfait the bug tracking project. Her research interests include programming languages, compiler construction and software security.

About Oracle Labs:

Oracle Labs, the research arm for Oracle, focuses on applied research that produces new technologies of interest to the company. Oracle Labs Australia, based in Brisbane, focuses on Program Analysis as it applies to a variety of domains, including bug-checking, security analysis, productivity tools, testing, and more. The group is best known for its research on static code analysis that led to scalable and precise bug-checking algorithms embedded in the Oracle Parfait tool.

At Nearmap, we're growing our AI Systems, and we’re after a machine learning engineer who’s got enough experience to just come in and get stuck in.
At Nearmap, we have petabytes of high quality aerial imagery (covering half a million square kilometres a year at 5-7cm resolution, and regularly captured imagery back to 2009). We've also just started producing automated 3D models of entire cities. Couple that with recent progress in deep learning, cloud based GPU compute, and the opportunity to work with a vast network of customers and partners eager to extract commercial value through machine learning for a wide range of industries and applications, and you'll appreciate why data science at Nearmap is an exciting place to be. As a mature publicly listed startup, we have both the resources to allow you to succeed in your role, and the agility (thanks to cloud-based infrastructure) to rapidly take advantage of the latest developments in the field.
While you know about Machine Learning and Data Science, you are at heart a software engineer with a passion for data. You will work as part of the AI Systems team to build internal infrastructure and tools, including RESTful APIs, databases, data pipelines, and deploying deep learning models at scale. You’ll be someone who thrives in a diverse team, working shoulder-to-shoulder with data scientists, statisticians, and other engineers.

Collaboration: We believe data science is a team sport, and are after candidates who can communicate well, share knowledge, and be open to taking on ideas from anyone in the team. Having worked on shared code-bases in a commercial environment is a big plus, but it's the attitude that matters most.
Technical Skills: A base of python, linux, and modern machine learning are key to any role in the team. The focus of this particular role is not just the ability to write clean code, but the ability to engineer complex software systems to support training and deployment of machine learning models on massive data sets. Experience with Kubernetes, Golang, Docker and cloud are highly valued.
Education and Experience: At minimum, a technical bachelors level degree (engineering, sciences, etc.), with a few years of experience beyond that (commercial or research).

270,PhD Scholarship Top-up – Defence Science and Technology Group,The University of Queensland,St Lucia QLD,"UQ’s Centre for Hypersonics has four PhD scholarship top-ups available for collaborative projects with the Defence Science and Technology Group (DST Group). The projects, detailed below, will be co-supervised by a DST scientist. The student will be based at UQ St Lucia, but will conduct their experiments at X3's new location with DST Group at Eaglefarm with DST technical support.
Projects 1 & 2: Radiation signatures
Supervisors: Professor Richard Morgan (principal) and Associate Professor Tim McIntyre (associate)
Prediction techniques are not currently well advanced, and more experimental data and fundamental studies are needed to be able to confidently categorise and predict the signatures of specific vehicle configurations over their operational envelopes. The requirements for experimental studies include advanced hypersonic test facilities, the ability to create the associated sources of ablative and combustion products, and the instrumentation required to track the propagation and spectral intensity of radiating products in a hypersonic flowfield. The laboratories of UQ and DST are well suited to perform such a study, and have extensive expertise in the related diagnostics and instrumentation.
Project 1: The purpose of this proposed project is to perform a series of experimental investigations into these effects, focussing on ablation-driven radiating wakes.
Project 2: The purpose of this proposed project is to perform a series of experimental investigations into these effects, focussing on wake signatures produced by propulsion systems.
Interested in these projects? Read more about Professor Richard Morgan, and Associate Professor Tim McIntyre. To discuss these projects, please email Associate Professor McIntyre.
Project 3: High altitude Earth re-entry testing in a large scale expansion tube
Supervisor: Dr David Gildfind
A manned mission to Mars will see the fastest ever spacecraft return to Earth, up to 13 km/s. The engineering challenges of Earth re-entry at these speeds are still to be overcome, and suitable wind tunnel testing capabilities will be essential to fully understand the flow physics and to test new technologies at these speeds. One promising technology is magnetohydrodynamic aerobraking, which can potentially use the interaction between a magnetic field and the hot plasma enveloping the spacecraft to dissipate the spacecraft's immense kinetic energy when it first reaches the atmosphere, when speeds are a maximum but density is low enough to make heating manageable.
Australia is currently a world leader in aerodynamic ground testing of planetary entry flows, and its X2 and X3 facilities are routinely used to study Earth re-entry flows up to 11 km/s. However, neither facility can currently generate the low density part of superorbital flows associated with ambitious future missions such as deep space return from Mars or the Gas Giants. This project involves extending the test capability for X3 - the world's largest free-piston driven expansion tube - to make this testing possible.
The PhD will address several technical challenges which currently prevent this performance. X3's free-piston driver is currently limited by its piston mass; its current lightest piston, which has been structurally optimised for CNC machining from aluminium, weighs 100kg, but for these test flows the piston needs to be much lighter. This can only be achieved through structural optimisation using new manufacturing techniques such as additive manufacturing.
Control of piston dynamics becomes increasingly difficult as mass is reduced and acceleration increases. This PhD will develop an accelerometer diagnostics package to measure piston trajectory and thereby guide the development of new driver operating conditions. A recent prototype device has demonstrated proof-of-concept up to 2000g peak acceleration for this application; this PhD must extend this performance to 20,000g, and will examine how additional diagnostics can be integrated into the device.
Model size must be maximised, which is achieved with a nozzle expansion to the test section. However, X3's existing nozzles have not been developed for such high speeds and low densities, and a new nozzle will also be necessary to achieve the new testing capability. This capability will be verified through numerical analysis and finally experimental testing. The outcome of this project will be the world's highest performance superorbital aerodynamic test capability for deep space return re-entry.
Interested? Read more about Dr David Gildfind, or email him about this project.
Project 4: Development of high performance shock tube conditions
Supervisor: Professor Richard Morgan
The performance of high speed shock tunnels is limited by the constraints of speed, pressure, length scale, and the required test flow duration. Related to this is the scope and scale of experiments which can be performed in the facilities. Recent modifications to the X3 facility at UQ have led to new test conditions in the reflected shock tunnel mode which enable steady flow durations of the order of 10 ms to be reached with an 800 mm nozzle exit. This new operating mode, known as X3R, is currently limited to total pressures of the order of 10 MPa at Mach 7 with a 560 kg piston. This envelope can potentially be stretched to total pressures of 40 MPa and enthalpies up to the order of 6 km/s, at the expense of test time, by using lighter pistons. The purpose of this thesis is to explore the full potential operating envelope of the facility, and establish a range of calibrated operating conditions which will greatly extend our capability to do useful hypersonics research. Honours Graduates from Engineering, the Physical Sciences and Applied Mathematics all have potentially suitable backgrounds for this project. There will be a strong experimental component to the work, and students will need to have good analytical and numerical skills.

‘Unlike any time in history, connecting the medium, the message, and its sequencing to the consumer is more vital than ever.
Connected creativity is the synchronization of strategic positioning, engaging creative, combined with the next generation of engagement planning to ensure ideas create the cut-through needed to deliver the strongest commercial performances. Today, creativity cannot be left to chance. One brand expression or big TV ad is simply not enough.
More than ever, brands need to live in culture and our consumers worlds, allowing audiences to not only consume brands, but take part in owning, creating and amplifying them. To do this, the role of influencers, publishers, the news and bought media are inseparable from each other and the expression of the idea itself. To create such work, the classic disciplines of the marketing mix – advertising, experience, PR, CRM, media, digital – must all be unified, removing P&Ls, biases and incumbency to reveal a new breed of agnostic agency, resulting in connected creativity.
At CHE Proximity, we see this as the shift from brand as advertising to brand as experience. It is as profound a change in advertising as the printing press was to the democratisation of information. We are investing our every effort into leading this transformation and in doing so, supporting the sustainability of our cherished industry as an essential ingredient of modern commerce.

307,Programmatic Manager,Clemenger Group,Melbourne VIC,"More than ever before the medium, the message and its sequencing are inseparable from each other.
Unlike any time in history, connecting the medium, the message, and its sequencing to the consumer is more vital than ever.
Connected creativity is the synchronization of strategic positioning, engaging creative, combined with the next generation of engagement planning to ensure ideas create the cut-through needed to deliver the strongest commercial performances. Today, creativity cannot be left to chance. One brand expression or big TV ad is simply not enough.
More than ever, brands need to live in culture and our consumers worlds, allowing audiences to not only consume brands, but take part in owning, creating and amplifying them. To do this, the role of influencers, publishers, the news and bought media are inseparable from each other and the expression of the idea itself. To create such work, the classic disciplines of the marketing mix – advertising, experience, PR, CRM, media, digital – must all be unified, removing P&Ls, biases and incumbency to reveal a new breed of agnostic agency, resulting in connected creativity.
At CHE Proximity, we see this as the shift from brand as advertising to brand as experience. It is as profound a change in advertising as the printing press was to the democratisation of information. We are investing our every effort into leading this transformation and in doing so, supporting the sustainability of our cherished industry as an essential ingredient of modern commerce.
This is what we call Connected Creativity.

That's why we're looking for a Programmatic Manager
If you're looking for a role where you change the way things are done, then this is it.
When we bought media in-house we didn't put it in a corner, instead we centralized it in the strategic planning department, within experience. Why? Because we believe experience starts with the very first exposure to a brand and so bought and owned channels should be planned together across the entire experience.
Our approach is driven by data and technology. Data is a huge part of what we do as an agency and media, particularly programmatic, is no different. We're fortunate to have some excellent data scientists working with us helping to build the latest and greatest in models. From a technology point of view, we're bringing adtech and martech together and have a team of developers enabling this. You'll also be surrounded by brand and innovation planners, a UX team and Creative Directors who are all incredibly excited about this new offering.
Our client base has grown rapidly and is continuing on this upward trajectory. All of our clients are looking for fresh thinking in media. They cover a range of industries across education, energy, health and other service providers.
We are backed by The Omnicom Media Group and have access to all tools, support and deals. We operate on the Google Tech Stack and are part of the OMG worldwide Google deal. We are also a partner of Adobe, operating Adobe Audience Manager as our DMP.
We are constantly evaluating new technology, data and media partners to ensure we're delivering the best programmatic offering and you'll be a key part of this. Our focus is delivering programmatic which lives up to future vision of right person, right place for the right money rather than its past. We're looking for someone who shares this vision and wants to be part of innovating and changing how we do things.

A day in the life

Delivering addressable recommendations for client which generate real business outcomes.
Running DBM for CHE Proximity.
Mentoring and training the team to be able to help implement these solutions.
Leading relationships with media and data partners ensuring access of new innovations to CHEP clients. This will be particularly so with Google's DBM team.
Leading optimizations throughout the campaign.
Guiding the team to deliver solutions for today, as well as exploring new and innovative solutions for tomorrow.
Working with the planning team on recommendations and the reporting team on data insights. It's worth noting that all of our planning is agnostic and we work as one team so you won't be fighting to get programmatic ‘heard'.
Working with other departments in the agency to solve client's business problems.
Helping to educate the wider agency and other departments.
How will we know you are the one?
Technical capabilities

A strong understanding of DBM.
A strong history of working in programmatic and leading accounts.
The ability to deliver recommendations on additional partners and platforms beyond DBM.
Intelligent use of data in client recommendations.
Knows how to extract useful insights from data.
The ability to lead relationships with key media partners for the agency.
The ability to mentor and lead a team.
The ability to lead the training of other members of the media team and working to promote cross skilling.
Experience with DMP's will be preferred, particularly Adobe Audience Manager.
Other things that would make you kick arse in this role

Why Qualtrics?
--------------

At Qualtrics, our mission is to close experience gaps—the costly differences between what customers and employees expect, and what they're receiving.

9,000+ organisations worldwide and more than 80% of the Fortune 100 rely on the Qualtrics Experience Management Platform™ to collect, analyse, and act on feedback—more feedback than they ever thought possible. With Qualtrics XM, organisations can handle the four core experiences of business—customer, employee, product, and brand experience. Organisations can be at every meaningful touchpoint, for every experience, and predict what will resonate most with customers and employees.

Employee Experience (or EX) is a major pillar of our business. Through our suite of listening tools, organisations are able to build ecosystems of employee feedback, from pre-hire to exit. Integrations and automation mean this can be done with minimal ongoing workload. While our platform is purpose-built to deliver the traditional annual engagement, we are helping organisations evolve their feedback programs to feel more fresh, agile and aligned with their business imperatives.

--------------
About the Team
--------------

Qualtrics is in the business of helping organisations manage experiences. Of all experiences an organisation delivers, employee experiences have a lasting impact on talent retention, productivity, and the overall bottom-line of the organisation. However, many of the world's organisations have followed a very outdated approach to understanding their employees.

As the employee landscape shifts, these outdated approaches are not delivering the insights required to truly engage their employee base. As such, these organisations are also looking for a new way to not just monitor, but understand and improve the experiences they deliver to their employees. Qualtrics has provided a new approach built on a foundation of elite technology and solid expertise that is getting results for many of the world's top organisations.

You will understand the significant industry shifts taking place in employee surveys, and be able to design visionary, creative yet impactful solutions to clients.

You are a strong presenter who represents Qualtrics at industry events and evangelising the work we do with customers.

342,Marketing Analyst,Deliveroo,Melbourne VIC,"Why Deliveroo?
When you first think about Deliveroo, you probably think of getting great food to your house in less than half an hour. Awesome right? But behind the scenes is the real story. This story is one of high growth, huge challenges and an enormous opportunity ahead of us. It began with our founder Will, arriving in London over 5 years ago and finding it almost impossible to order great food, despite the wealth of incredible restaurants in the city. Fast forward 5 years and we operate in 13 countries with over 50,000 riders who deliver orders from 50,000 restaurants in over 200 cities worldwide.
We want to be the definitive food company - the app you go to any time you have a hunger pang. We are transforming the way people think about food. We are providing people with limitless access to different cuisines and restaurants, turning cooking from a chore to a choice, and giving people the freedom to eat what they want, when they want, where they want it.
We work with riders, restaurants and consumers. We operate one of the most complex three sided marketplaces in the world and we do this in real time. Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds. The algorithms behind that marketplace are the secret sauce that allow us to deliver our orders in under 30 minutes.
And we’re just getting started
The scale of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. The global food market is valued at £7.7 trillion but only 1% of it is currently online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of countless other industries - from banking and travel to retail and communications - it’s clear that our journey in the food sector has only just begun.
We are already a multi-billion dollar company that is more than doubling in size every year. Deliveroo came top in the FT’s’ list of Europe’s fastest growing 1000 companies in 2018, and we were the first company ever to win Deloitte’s ‘UK Top 50’ two years in a row. Yet most of the extraordinary value this company will generate lies ahead of us.
The Role
We are looking for a Marketing Analyst to join our team based in our Melbourne Head Office. The primary role of the Marketing Analyst will be to support the marketing team with various data requests. This role is responsible for the creation and design of reports and reporting tools as well as the provision of data analysis to deliver insights to key decision makers to assist in all marketing planning and analysis.
The role will involve:
Providing analytical support across the broader marketing team, by assisting in setting up effective post-analysis and reporting
Analysing the impact of marketing activity on business performance
Support marketing in driving campaign effectiveness through ongoing optimisation of data selection and KPI development
Creating and managing visualisation analysis using Looker, excel and other programs
Collaborating with other data scientists and marketing colleagues to drive and continually improve reporting solutions
Converting gathered data into easily comprehensible information and dispersing insights and recommendations across the team and management
Understanding and optimising return on marketing investment
Continually improving all data processes within the marketing team.
Creation, roll out & ownership of processes, tools and reporting dashboards to improve internal efficiency
Support marketing team with Ad hoc analysis, insights and reporting requests
Requirements:
The ideal candidate is highly analytical with a strong set of organizational and communication skills. You’ll be able to think strategically, validate your assumptions with data, and then execute quickly on your plans.
You should also be:
Driven, hard-working and agile. We move fast at Deliveroo and you’ll be comfortable with the same
Extremely analytical and have a passion for detail, marketing and data crunching
Resourceful, creative, and with a keen eye for leveraging data insights to help our marketing team make more insightful business decisions. You’re detail-oriented and able to maintain a high level of accuracy across all aspects of your work.
Able to create reports and dashboards such as Looker, Power Bi or Tableau to be used by marketing and business stakeholders
Comfortable working with individuals at all levels. You must be a team player and able to galvanise support from colleagues across departments and cities.
An expert in Excel. Experience using SQL, Looker and Google Suite would be beneficial
Life at Deliveroo
We are a growing team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we’re always looking for new ideas and we’re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.
There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven’t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.
Benefits and Diversity
At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.
In 2018 we announced our decision to give every employee equity in the company. We did this because we wanted all of our employees, regardless of location, level or role to be owners and because we believe that this is the right thing to do. We believe this helps build a culture where everyone is committed and able to share in the company’s success.
We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing start-up’s around."

At Nearmap, we're growing our AI Systems, and we’re after a machine learning engineer who’s got enough experience to just come in and get stuck in.
At Nearmap, we have petabytes of high quality aerial imagery (covering half a million square kilometres a year at 5-7cm resolution, and regularly captured imagery back to 2009). We've also just started producing automated 3D models of entire cities. Couple that with recent progress in deep learning, cloud based GPU compute, and the opportunity to work with a vast network of customers and partners eager to extract commercial value through machine learning for a wide range of industries and applications, and you'll appreciate why data science at Nearmap is an exciting place to be. As a mature publicly listed startup, we have both the resources to allow you to succeed in your role, and the agility (thanks to cloud-based infrastructure) to rapidly take advantage of the latest developments in the field.
While you know about Machine Learning and Data Science, you are at heart a software engineer with a passion for data. You will work as part of the AI Systems team to build internal infrastructure and tools, including RESTful APIs, databases, data pipelines, and deploying deep learning models at scale. You’ll be someone who thrives in a diverse team, working shoulder-to-shoulder with data scientists, statisticians, and other engineers.
A bit more about the culture…

Collaboration: We believe data science is a team sport, and are after candidates who can communicate well, share knowledge, and be open to taking on ideas from anyone in the team. Having worked on shared code-bases in a commercial environment is a big plus, but it's the attitude that matters most.
Technical Skills: A base of python, linux, and modern machine learning are key to any role in the team. The focus of this particular role is not just the ability to write clean code, but the ability to engineer complex software systems to support training and deployment of machine learning models on massive data sets. Experience with Kubernetes, Golang, Docker and cloud are highly valued.
Education and Experience: At minimum, a technical bachelors level degree (engineering, sciences, etc.), with a few years of experience beyond that (commercial or research).
Attention to detail: Showing attention to detail when it counts is important... to be considered for this role, click this link and apply some basic data science skills (an astute software engineer should be able to solve it quickly with a little googling!).

452,Software Engineer,Onset,Sydney NSW,"You spend most of your life at work and it’s widely accepted that you learn the most from the people you work with, so if you join somewhere mediocre, chances are….

If you want better for yourself then you will need to work with the best, and that’s what you’ll find here.

Don’t take my word for it though, Lars Rasmussen, Computer Scientist, Software Developer and the Co-Founder of Google Maps described the Founder of this company as one of the best engineers in Australia (drop me a message, I’ll send you the article).

So, with that in mind, you can be confident you are going to be building something meaningful and hugely complex, but what is it?

It’s a cloud-based 3D design tool built in C++ and Javascript for the utility sectors and despite being less than 2 years old, has already been implemented by multiple enterprise clients in Australia and received recent government funding.

You’ll be working with Machine Learning, developing complex algorithms and building physics simulation engines which pull data in real-time from data sources including IoT, photography, LiDAR and more.

What do they want from you?

With multiple vacancies, there is space for everyone from Junior to Senior Engineers and Developers.

The expectation is you’ll come from a Computer Science background, have worked with data structures and be comfortable with mathematics.

It’s important you love what you do, if you have hobbyist projects or contribute to platforms like Github or Stackoverflow then that’s a strong indicator.

A good programmer is agnostic so whether you cut code in C++, C# or Java, it doesn’t really matter, what matters is your desire to refine your skills.

So, if you want to guarantee yourself a future working with one of Australia’s best and brightest engineers and secure shares in their rapidly scaling business, drop me (Julien) a message, you can reach me at julien@theonset.com.au or 0406 158 832.

I look forward to hearing from you!"

496,Paid Search Manager,Clemenger Group,Melbourne VIC,"More than ever before the medium, the message and it's sequencing are inseparable from each other.
Unlike any time in history, connecting the medium, the message, and its sequencing to the consumer is more vital than ever.
Connected creativity is the synchronization of strategic positioning, engaging creative, combined with the next generation of engagement planning to ensure ideas create the cut-through needed to deliver the strongest commercial performances. Today, creativity cannot be left to chance. One brand expression or big TV ad is simply not enough.
More than ever, brands need to live in culture and our consumers worlds, allowing audiences to not only consume brands, but take part in owning, creating and amplifying them. To do this, the role of influencers, publishers, the news and bought media are inseparable from each other and the expression of the idea itself. To create such work, the classic disciplines of the marketing mix – advertising, experience, PR, CRM, media, digital – must all be unified, removing P&Ls, biases and incumbency to reveal a new breed of agnostic agency, resulting in connected creativity.
At CHE Proximity, we see this as the shift from brand as advertising to brand as experience. It is as profound a change in advertising as the printing press was to the democratisation of information. We are investing our every effort into leading this transformation and in doing so, supporting the sustainability of our cherished industry as an essential ingredient of modern commerce.
This is what we call Connected Creativity.

That's why we're looking for a Search Manager
This role is a foundation role. You'll have the chance to help build the offering from the ground up. Not only is it a full service model, but it's also centralised within strategic planning in the experience team. Why? Because we believe experience starts with the very first exposure to a brand and so bought and owned channels should be planned together across the entire experience.
Our approach is driven by behaviour based media planning. Data is a huge part of what we do as an agency and media is no different. We're fortunate to have some excellent data scientists working with us helping to build the latest and greatest in models. You'll also be surrounded by brand and innovation planners, a UX team and Creative Directors who are all incredibly excited about this new offering.
Our client base has grown rapidly and is continuing on this upward trajectory. All of our clients are fully integrated (across digital and ATL channels) and are looking for fresh thinking in media. And they love search (as do we)! They cover a range of industries across education, energy, health and other service providers.
We are backed by The Omnicom Media Group and have access to all tools, support and deals. We use the Google Tech Stack.

A day in the life

Helping to deliver strategic search recommendations for clients.
Leading implementation, ongoing insights and optimizations.
Working with other departments in the agency to solve client's business problems.
Helping to educate the wider agency and other departments on the role of ‘search' and its importance.
How will we know you're the one?
Technical capabilities

An understanding of the industry. Ideally 4+ years of experience.
A history of working in search and other performance based media.
The ability to implement search across ad words and Bing.
The ability to use bid management tools.
The ability to help in generating insights from reporting.
The ability to lead the training of other members of the media team and working to promote cross skilling.
The ability to work in a team and with other departments in the agency to solve client's business problems.
Other things that would make you succeed in this role

An ambition to change the way things are done
Is not intimidated by the idea of working in new ways and with new technology

509,Strategy and Experience Director (Media),Clemenger Group,Sydney NSW,"More than ever before the medium, the message and it's sequencing are inseparable from each other
‘Unlike any time in history, connecting the medium, the message, and its sequencing to the consumer is more vital than ever.
Connected creativity is the synchronization of strategic positioning, engaging creative, combined with the next generation of engagement planning to ensure ideas create the cut-through needed to deliver the strongest commercial performances. Today, creativity cannot be left to chance. One brand expression or big TV ad is simply not enough.
More than ever, brands need to live in culture and our consumers worlds, allowing audiences to not only consume brands, but take part in owning, creating and amplifying them. To do this, the role of influencers, publishers, the news and bought media are inseparable from each other and the expression of the idea itself. To create such work, the classic disciplines of the marketing mix – advertising, experience, PR, CRM, media, digital – must all be unified, removing P&Ls, biases and incumbency to reveal a new breed of agnostic agency, resulting in connected creativity.
At CHE Proximity, we see this as the shift from brand as advertising to brand as experience. It is as profound a change in advertising as the printing press was to the democratisation of information. We are investing our every effort into leading this transformation and in doing so, supporting the sustainability of our cherished industry as an essential ingredient of modern commerce.
This is what we call Connected Creativity.

That's why we are looking for the new breed of Strategy and Experience Director
This role is a foundation role in our Melbourne team. You'll have the chance to help build the planning offering from the ground up. Not only is it a full service model, but it's also centralised within strategic planning in the experience team. Why? Because we believe experience starts with the very first exposure to a brand and so bought and owned channels should be planned together across the entire experience.
Our approach is driven by behaviour based media planning. Data is a huge part of what we do as an agency and media is no different. We're fortunate to have some excellent data scientists working with us helping to build the latest and greatest in models.

Our client base has grown rapidly and is continuing on this upward trajectory. All of our clients are fully integrated (across digital and ATL channels) and are looking for fresh thinking in media. They cover a range of industries across education, energy, health, finance and other service providers.
We are backed by The Omnicom Media Group and have access to all tools, support and deals. However, like with other Omnicom Media Group agencies we are looking for value to be recognized at a client level.
The role is a more strategic role than your average ‘media planner' role. You will be working with our group of strategic planners (including other Strategic Media Planners) to deliver solutions to client's business problems. Trading is run out of a dedicated trading team, with whom you will work closely.

A day in the life:
Leading the strategic media planning for a number of key Melbourne clients.
Creating strategic packs which answer our clients key business needs
Working with other strategic planners (data, experience, brand, innovation) to align the media strategy with other strategic functions.
Building and mentoring the team as it grows as a senior leader of the Sydney media team as well as being a part of the overall media leadership group nationally
Working with the trading team to help bring strategies to life.
Working with media partners and other members of the team to help develop relationships.
Helping to educate the wider agency and other departments.
Working with other departments in the agency to solve client's business problems.
How will we know you are the one?
Technical capabilities

A strong understanding of the industry particularly in the Melbourne markets. Ideally 5+ years of experience.
A proven history of strong strategic outputs.
The ability to create a narrative around a strategy to help to bring it to life.
Ideally fully integrated, however we will consider candidates with a strong skill set predominately in digital.
An understanding of data, how it can be used and its importance will be preferred.
Equally any understanding of DMP or the Adobe Marketing Cloud will also be preferred.
The ability to lead relationships with media partners for the agency.
Experience across industry standard tools. Plus the ability to lead the search for new and innovative solutions.
The ability to work in a team and with other departments in the agency to solve client's business problems.
The desire to look forward, review interesting trends both inside and outside the industry and contribute to the vision of the agency
